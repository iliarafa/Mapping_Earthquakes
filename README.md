# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days while trying to 
understand the correlation between magnitude and location.

## The Map

### The Circle Markers

Displayed on the map we find the following layers of data: 

- All earthquake data for the past 7 days.
- All major earthquake data for the past 7 days. 

### The Thin Yellow Line
The thin yellow line is our final layer and displays the positions of tectonic plates. 

The combination of all three filters display the intense seismic activity in the areas where those plates meet. 

Layers are switched on by default and the user may disable them. 

Three map styles are available. Street, Satellite and Night maps provide the viewer with three background options. 

## The tools
This project is 82.0% JavaScript, 14.5% HTML and 3.5% CSS.
